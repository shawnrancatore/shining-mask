# shining-mask
Project that allows you to easily control the LED Mask with any CircuitPython device that has bluetooth and to gesture using a Wii Nunchuck.

Make sure that you load some custom images to the mask before trying this.

The images in the examples folder plus this code for controlling the mask will allow you to make a talking and blinking meeseeks face that will amaze your Rick and Morty loving friends. 

You can create your own images to customize the mask.
